# 🧮 Calculator API - Spring Boot Application

This is a simple, extensible calculator REST API built using Spring Boot. It was developed as part of an assignment to demonstrate clean code practices, use of enums, validation, and a layered architecture.

---

## 🚀 Features

- RESTful API for performing basic arithmetic operations
- Enum-based operation handling (`ADD`, `SUBTRACT`, `MULTIPLY`, `DIVIDE`)
- Case-insensitive operation input (e.g., `"add"`, `"Add"`, `"ADD"` are all valid)
- Input validation with `@Valid`
- Clear separation between controller, service, and model layers

---

## 🛠 Technologies Used

- Java 17
- Spring Boot 3.x
- Maven
- Lombok (for boilerplate reduction)
- Jackson (for JSON parsing)
